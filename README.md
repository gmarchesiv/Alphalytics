This repository contains the data and analysis for portfolio optimization using dynamic asset allocation through the business cycle. 

The goal of this project is to maximize the historic return of an investment portfolio by optimizing the asset allocation during the four stages of an economic cycle: 
1. Recovery: period immediately after a slowdon or recession  
2. Expansion: stable growth period after a recovery period 
3. Slowdown: period of stagnant or decreasing growth that may precede a recessions or might happen in the middle of a cycle
4. Contraction: period of decreasing growth, following a slowdown

The chosen assets for this analysis are the following ETFs:

The algorithn optimizes by risk adjusted weight at the asset allocation. At the asset level, a second type of algorithm, a trading algorithm seeks to maximize the return of the asset by trading on the signals of price change for different hourly/daily periods and market volatility as represented by VIX. Trading algorithms are the authors IP and will not be shared, though results will be presented in the writeup section. 

This repository is divided in four sections: 
1. Data: the compiled csv data to run the workbooks
2. Analysis: the python notebooks
3. Writeumps
